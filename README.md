# -Tableau-WorldHappinessReport Data Analysis and Visualization 
completed as a part of Internal Assessment under the course Data Visualization by Esha Shelar and Arva Kachwala.
Analyzed economic, social scenarios of various nations across the globe to find a relationship with the happiness index.

World Happiness Report uses global survey data to report how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries worldwide. 
It is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. 
The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. 
This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale.
The dataset was collected from Kaggle and the data was visualized using dashboards on Tableau.
